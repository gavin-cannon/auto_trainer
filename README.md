# Overview

I wanted to learn Flutter to be able to develop native apps that work on both Ios and Android.

This app is was meant for me to get a feel for what using Flutter might be like when building an exercise generation app that I have wanted to make since 2023.

The purpose of this app is two fold. One to learn a new skill as a developer and gain a greater understanding of the technical landscape. Two to build a understanding of what app development will be like and take a first stab at my workout generator to see what I am overlooking and need to account for in the future.
